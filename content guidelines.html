    ‘Hi-Five’
Welcome to the InsightYou Content Guidelines. Below factors that make a content suggestion worthy. If you keep these guidelines in mind, then nothing stopping your content to get published.<br><br>

<h3>Go in-depth</h3>
Our members are here to learn, members love long-form content that is filled with professional insights and details. Content that only touches the surface of a topic with no deep dive into a new perspective or understanding of a process won’t satisfy members’ thirst for knowledge.<br><br>

<h3>Verify the link</h3>
Every suggested link must take Insighter directly to the English language content being suggested. A link leading to a website’s homepage instead of a specific content item won’t be accepted. <br><br>

<h3>Stay on the topic and Just tell</h3>
Our professional members are looking to improve their knowledge and avoid content fluff. Community members love actionable advice and fruitful recommendations. If your suggested content is overly sales-oriented and highlights a single brand, then chances are that the content will not be approved.<br><br>

<h3>High quality</h3>
If the suggested content includes the poor video quality, audio quality, bad grammar, and difficult to understand, then members aren't going to benefit from it, hence it might not get approved. <br><br>

<h3>Avoid over-gating your content</h3>
If accessing of content requires our members to pass through several steps or answer a lot of questions, the suggestion probably won’t be approved.Also, wedon’t sendour members to content that is locked behind a paywall.<br><br>
